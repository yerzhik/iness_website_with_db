 'The rechargeable lithium ion battery (LIB) has crucial demands of our modern society, such as power source of various devices, EV and HEV. However, conventional LIB suffer from safety problems because they contain volatile and flammable organic solvents in the electrolyte solution. In order to improve the safety, alternative material systems for the electrolyte are urgently desired today. In this respect, there are many studies for developing (1) inorganic solid compound electrolytes, (2) ionic liquid electrolytes, (3) poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) which has been known to be typically representative of the polymer matrix for all solid polymer electrolytes(SPEs). We thought that the selection of the PEO-based SPEs would be the fastest way for the realization of large-scale LIB with nonflammable property. While PEO-based SPEs containing supporting agent LITFSI have relatively low ionic conductivity (10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>) at a room temperature. In our group, the addition of aluminate ester (Al-PEG) to monomer (poly(ethylene glycol) mono-methacrylate) ( MPG-130MA) containing LITFSI has been tried for anticipating both the increase of the ionic conductivity from the effect of the Lewis acidity of Al in Al-PEG and of the nonflammable property. In other words, we expected the easier diffusion of lithium ion by adding Al-PEG. Al-PEG usually has three EO chains with each methyl end. In our group, one of the methyl ends was replaced by methacrylate (-CO(CH<sub>3</sub>)C=CH<sub>2</sub>). It is considered that the C=C double bond in the monomer of both MPG-130MA and Al-PEG might react in each other during polymerization reaction by heating or irradiating UV and form stable polymer chain for keeping good segmental motion of lithium ion conduction. In some of the SPEs, 20wt%of triglyme (DMTG) was added to monomer as a prasticizer to increase the ionic conductivity of lithium ion. The ionic conductivity of obtained SPE containing 5wt% of Al-PEG showed 10<sup>-4</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 60 degree C and the value was a little higher than that of the SPE without Al-PEG (10<sup>-4.7</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>). Also Cyclic voltammogram of the same SPE showed stable behavior in the voltage range between 2.0 V and 5.0 V at temperatures until 70 degree C. We constructed laminate-type cell using the SPE containing 5wt% of Al-PEG. LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) and Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LTO) were selected as the cathode and the anode, respectively. Relatively high charge discharge performance was observed even at a high temperature 100 degree C. In this case, no prasticizer was added, because easier volatility happened at such higher temperatures.', DEFAULT ),

'Sodium-ion batteries have been considered as potential candidates for stationary energy storage because of the low cost and wide availability of Na sources. In this work, a fast and facile mechanochemical approach has been used to prepare a few promising Na-based cathode materials. Structure and morphology were analyzed by XRD with Rietveld refinement using GSAS and TOPAS software packages, SEM, FTIR, MÓ§ssbauer, <sup>23</sup>Na and <sup>31</sup>P MAS NMR. Electrochemical properties were studied by galvanostatic cycling in Na- and Li-cells and GITT. Low-crystalline sodium iron fluorophosphate Na<sub>2</sub>FePO<sub>4</sub>F was formed as a result of direct mechanochemical interaction of NaFePO<sub>4</sub> with NaF, while well-crystalline Na<sub>2</sub>FePO<sub>4</sub>F was prepared after annealing of the activated mixture at 600C [1]. Na<sub>2</sub>FePO<sub>4</sub>F has a layered structure (S.G.Pbcn) and possesses two-dimensional pathways for facile Na+/Li+ transport and minimal structural changes upon oxidation/reduction. The average operation voltage is ~3.0 V vs. Na/Na+ and ~3.3 V vs. Li/Li+. When cycling in Li cells, Na+ ions are gradually substituted by Li+ ions. After Na+/Li+ exchange up to NaLiFePO4F, the initial framework is maintained unchanged; the dischargecapacity reaches 116 mAh/g. The process occurs via a predominant Li extraction-insertion owing to the vast excess of Li in the cell and has a solid solution mechanism. A series of sodium vanadium fluorophosphates Na<sub>1+x</sub>VPO<sub>4</sub>F<sub>1+x</sub> (0&lex&le0.5) was prepared by annealing the activated mixtures of VPO<sub>4</sub> and NaF at 600C [2]. The main phase in all samples is Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>(x=0.5) which crystallizes in a tetrahedral symmetry (S.G.P4<sub>2</sub>/mnm). The samples with x<0.5 contain some impurity phases. The alkaline ion (de)insertion proceeds in two different steps located at 3.6 V and 4.0 V vs. Na/Na+ and 3.9 V and 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+. Although the samples show similar electrochemical behavior, the highest capacity (117 mAh/g) and the best capacity retention was observed for Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>. Stoichiometric Na<sub>2</sub>FeP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and non-stoichiometric Na<sub>1.56</sub>Fe<sub>1.22</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> sodium iron pyrophosphates were prepared from a mixture of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, FeC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O and (NH<sub>4<sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> [3]. Both samples adopt a triclinic structure (S.G.P-1) and characterized by structural disorder and a noticeable amount of Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions due to high activity to O<sub>2</sub>. The samples show sloping solid solution-like charge-discharge profiles with an average voltage of 3.0 V and 3.3 V upon cycling in Na and Li cells. The practical capacity is ~90 mAh/gfor Na<sub>2</sub>FeP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and 100 mAh/g for Na<sub>1.56</sub>Fe<sub>1.22</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.

'To compare the characterization of microstructure and electrochemical properties between two binary alloys (Cr-Si, Ni-Si), two composition of binary alloys with the same capacity were selected using phase-diagram and made with matrix-stabilization method to suppress the volume expansion of Si by inactive-matrix.

Also, powder samples were produced by wet grinding for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical measurements. As predicted from the phase diagram, only active-Si and inactive-matrix (CrSi<sub>2</sub>,NiSi<sub>2</sub>) were detected. The results of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) show that Cr-Si alloy has finer microstructure than Ni-Si alloy, which was also predictable through phase diagram. The electrochemical properties related to microstructure were evaluated by coin type full-and half-cells. Separately, self-designed test-cells were used to measure the volume expansion of Si. Volume expansion of Cr-Si alloy electrode with finer microstructure was suppressed significantly and improved in cycle capability, in comparison Ni-Si alloy with coarse microstructure.

'A new method for the production of nanosized zeolite powder by a top-down approach has been performed. [1,2] In this study, ZSM-5 (MFI type structure) was first milled to produce a nanopowder. This technique can destroy the outer portion of the zeolite framework, which lowers the micropore volume of ZSM-5 zeolite. To remedy this, the damaged part was recrystallized using a dilute aluminosilicate solution after bead milling. From the combined bead milling and post-milling recrystallization, nanosized ZSM-5 zeolite approximately 50 nm in size with high crystallinity was obtained successfully. Commercial ZSM-5 was milled using a bead milling apparatus (Minicer, AshizawaFinetech, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 2-6 hours. Recrystallization of the milled ZSM-5 was performed using dilute silicate solution with the composition of 0.0525 Na<sub>2</sub>O :0.117 SiO<sub>2</sub>: 10.0 H<sub>2</sub>O. The importance of this particular ratio is that it provides a solution nearly in equilibrium with ZSM-5. This means that ZSM-5 neither undergoes macroscopic growth nor dissolution. Under these conditions, the remaining ZSM-5 crystallites act as seeds and the poorly crystalline parts of the milled ZSM-5 are more easily recrystallized back onto the ZSM-5, resulting in a more ordered product. Obtained samples were evaluated as acid-catalysts for cumene cracking. The test reactions were conducted so that diffusion through the zeolite pore structure was the ratedetermining step of the catalytic reaction. As a result, ZSM-5 zeolite powder showed a higher catalytic activity in cumene cracking in comparison with the raw ZSM-5 zeolite. Furthermore, the decrease in crystal size suppresses catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during cumene cracking.', DEFAULT ),

Two-phase mechanism of Li+ deintercalation-intercalation is typical for LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, but for Mn-substituted olivines extraction and insertion of Li+ occurs via single phase in broad ranges of composition [1], [2].

'Small electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantages of low visual, heat and acoustic signatures, but have only limited flight endurance. For electric motor/battery powered UAV designs, to increase the flight endurance means an increase in the weight of the onboard battery, which in turn adds to the overall weight of the UAV and hence more power, is used, especially during the ascent and possibly loiter stages of the mission. A marked increase in the aircraftâs endurance can be achieved with the inclusion of an internal combustion engine in the design, but this will result in high noise levels and possibly an unwanted heat signature.

'Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have received a lot of attention since a pioneer report on sulfur as a cathode material for rechargeable batteries in 1979 [1]. Cathode and anode compositions were the core research focus of latest publications that aimed to mitigate unfavorable capacity loss in Li-S electrochemical cells. Meanwhile, the investigation scope of advanced battery separators as potential polysulfide shield was rather limited. Separator is a crucial battery component for insulating electrodes and facilitating ion exchange through the porous structure. Alongside primary functions, separator is required to provide chemical stability under strong reducing and oxidizing conditions, secure mechanical (dimensional) stability at high temperatures (overcharge conditions) to prevent short-circuit, exhibit high puncture strength, readily soak and retain electrolyte for good ionic conductivity [2]. Commercial microporous polyolefin based separators offer excellent mechanical strength and chemical stability; they shrink, soften and even melt at high temperatures. However, melting causes short-circuiting between the electrodes in the case of unusual heat generation. Thermal stability of polyolefin based commercial separator was improved by deposition of a thin (~100 nm) (polyacrylic acid/clay/polyethyleneimine)<sub>n</sub> (PAA/clay/PEI)<sub>n</sub> coatings on its surface by the LbL technique, where clay is montmorillonite and halloysite. Investigation of surface properties of coated of polyolefin Celgard 2400 separator revealed the formation of uniform, highly wettable and ion-conductive coating. Meanwhile, the coating demonstrates exceptional thermal, dimensional stability and remarkably increased coulombic efficiency from 50% for pristine polypropylene film to nearly 80% by preventing a shuttle effect of soluble species. The advanced cell performance is ascribed to a special structure of the composite electrolytes and specific pH dependence of clays.

The analysis of the literature shows the experimental data on the abundance of the electrochemical preparation of titanium nanostructures (mainly nanotubes).

'Last years, a new method of growing of thin low-defective SiC films on Si was theoretically developed and experimentally realized [1]. The method is based on the substitution of part of silicon atoms in matrix by carbon atoms to form silicon carbide molecules: 2Si + CO â SiC + SiO. SiC films were synthesized in a special furnace described in [1]. SiC films studied earlier [1] had been typically grown on standard silicon substrates of p- and n-types of conductivity. 	It was shown [1] that the higher the quality of the initial Si substrates, the higher the quality of the grown SiC layer. 	In this regard, the aim of this work is the study of the formation of SiC films on the surface of the low-defective silicon substrate of brand M-5168 with resistivity ranged 1987â3165 Ohmâcm. 	Two series (â 1 and 2) of SiC samples were grown for 15 min at a temperature of 1250 Â°C and a gas CO pressure of 264 Pa on silicon substrates. Two other series (â 3 and 4) of SiC samples were prepared at conditions: 1330 Â°C, 395 Pa, 7 minutes [2]. 	The phase composition and structure of the films were studied by X-ray diffraction using Debye chamber and narrowly-collimated (0.05Ã1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) monochromatic (CuK<sub>Î±</sub>) X-ray beam. 	It is clearly shown that the X-ray diffraction patterns contain almost all known lines of Î²-SiC (3C-SiC). The overlay of single reflex corresponding to large crystal of Î²-SiC for the some lines of Î²-SiC nanocrystalline phase, are also observed. Using the method of Clark and Zimmer, based on measurement of the spot sizes, the sizes of large Î²-SiC crystals were determined. For sample â 2 the crystal sizes have the values about 130Ã35 Âµm in the plane (111), 70Ã60 Âµm in (200), 85Ã70 Âµm in (311) and 60Ã85 Âµm in (420). For the sample â 3, a SiC reflex comparable in sizes with the reflex of the Si substrate or the beam size, is observed. This reflex on Î²-SiC (333) line corresponds to a crystal with a section above 365Ã220 Î¼m and indicates the presence of the monocrystalline layer of Î²-SiC. Using Jones method, the average sizes of Î²-SiC nanocrystals in transition region "film-substrate" were determined, which are equal (for sample â 2) 4.5 nm in the (111) plane, 3.1 nm in the (220) plane, and 3.0 nm in the (311) plane. 	Thus, it is shown that the film comprises a single crystalline and nanocrystalline phases of Î²-SiC.', DEFAULT ),

'Nanoscale refractory metal films are known for their superior mechanical and heat-resistant properties which make them unique for variety of research and industrial applications. In this work we investigate elastic and structural properties of thin films fabricated from Tungsten (W), Molybdenum (Mo) and Tantalum (Ta) refractory metals. These materials with thin film thicknesses ranging from 25 nm up to 450 nm were deposited on Si (100) substrates by RF magnetron sputtering technique. Film thicknesses were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while their crystal structure and orientation were studied by Î¸-2Î¸ scan X-ray diffraction (XRD). Film densities were measured by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique [1]. Their elastic moduli were determined from the phonon dispersion relation obtained by nanosecond laser pulse-induced surface acoustic wave (SAW) velocities as a function of SAW frequencies [2]. This laser-acoustic technique requires film thickness, film density and substrate properties as input parameters. Figure 1 presents the results of measured elastic modulus values of the films depending on their thickness. It can be observed that these values increase with the thickness until reaching some plateau. For the same film thickness the Young modulus values are saturated at a higher level for harder film material. It is also seen that Ta film samples with thicknesses from 50 nm to 410 nm have Elastic modulus higher than their bulk. QCM results showed that density values of the films do not reach their bulk densities. Analysis of XRD profiles showed that for all of the films the peaks appear at slightly lower angles than expected which can indicate the presence of compressive stress inside the films. In addition, most of the peaks on XRD profiles are associated with the expected peak positions from literature values. Obtained mechanical parameters of nanoscale-thick films will be discussed in the light of their microstructural properties.', DEFAULT ),

'Mercury pollution of water has become a serious environmental and public issue around the world. Therefore, there is a growing need for development of highly efficient mercury remediation techniques. Herein, possibility of removal of mercury (II) ions from aqueous solution by using silver nanoparticles immobilized on the surface of modified silica substrate is reported. The first stage of the project involves synthesis of surface modified silica support and generation of the metal nanoparticles on it. The âsilanizationâ method was applied for modification of fumed silica by the reaction with triethoxysilane (TES) solution in order to attach silicon hydride groups onto the surface of silica. The silica hydride functional groups possess reducing properties towards precious metal ions. Therefore, the modified silica was subsequently used in generation of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the support. It was determined that the generated silver nanoparticles are of high purity and stably immobilized on the surface of the silica support. In addition, it was found that the concentration of silver nitrate solution and contact time between silicon hydride groups and silver ions linearly affect the size of generated metal nanoparticles. At the second stage, synthesized silver nanoparticles on silica support were tested in a solution containing mercury (II) ions. In order to verify uptake of mercury from solution classic method such as indirect titration technique using EDTA was employed. The obtained results of mercury content remained in solution were found to be inconclusive. Therefore, the stoichiometry of silver-mercury interaction cannot be analysed, more sensitive and precise equipment such as Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) should be used. 	The current research is significant mainly due to two reasons. First reason is relatively cheap synthesis of size controlled and pure silver nanoparticles without using any stabilizing agents. Generated silver nanoparticles do no aggregate and stably immobilized on silica support. Previously reported chemical synthesis methods involve numerous inorganic and organic stabilizers to prevent particle aggregation which, consequently, affect the purity of produced silver nanoparticles and its adsorptive qualities. Secondly, fabricated silver nanoparticles on silica support can be subsequently used in the purification of water systems contaminated with mercury (II) ions. ', DEFAULT ),

MgB<sub>2</sub> has a transition temperature Tc of about 40 K, the highest in conventional superconductors and nearly two times the previous record in such superconductors. Bulk MgB<sub>2</sub> superconductor was synthesized from elemental magnesium and boron powders in thermal explosion mode of Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis under the pressure of 25 Atm. XRD pattern of the as-synthesized product indicates an almost complete conversion of the reactants to the MgB<sub>2</sub> single phase. Most of the diffraction peaks correlate with the MgB<sub>2</sub> polycrystalline bulk material.
Impurities comprise less than 24.3% of total mass and are identified as MgO and MgB<sub>4</sub> secondary phases. The typical morphology of prepared polycrystalline bulk MgB<sub>2</sub> sample consists of heterogeneously distributed grains having particle conglomerates. It is stated, the preparation of dense MgB<sub>2</sub> bulk superconducting material through single-step SHS method under Ar gas pressure is beneficiary to enhance the critical current density JC.

The general behavior of magnetization for as-synthesized MgB<sub>2</sub> sample by SHS method under the pressure of Ar gas is very similar to that of conventional MgB<sub>2</sub> superconductor polycrystalline materials. The negative signals in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) curve clearly indicate a SC state with an onset transition temperature at TC = 39 K.

'Perfluorosulfonated polymers such as NafionÂ® have been used as electrolyte membranes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their high proton conductivity and chemical stability. However, those electrolyte membranes require water to retain high proton conductivity. As a result, the operating temperature of PEFCs is being limited below 100 Â°C although the activity of catalysts used for oxygen cathode and hydrogen anode can be improved as increasing the temperature. Thus, new electrolyte materials, which can be used at higher temperatures than 100 Â°C without humidification, are being required. Ionic liquids (ILs), which are molten salts at room temperature, have attracted considerable attention as promising electrolyte materials for non-humidified intermediate-temperature PEFCs because of their special characteristics such as non-volatility, non-flammability, high thermal stability and electrochemical stability. However, the over-potential and kinetics of electrochemical oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in ILs are basically large and slow, respectively. In order to solve this problem, we have investigated interfacial phenomena between Pt electrode and ILs in the course of ORRs by in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy combining with electrochemical measurements, and revealed that the adsorption and desorption behavior of the anion in ILs strongly affects the ORR activity. Based on this result, we focused a series of ILs consisting of N,N-diethylmethylamine (dema) and three kinds of fluoroalkylsulfonic acids having different chain lengths (H-SO<sub>3</sub>(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>F, n = 1~3), and applied them as electrolytes for non-humidified intermediate-temperature PEFCs. Those ILs are difficult to use directly in the fuel cells due to fluidity. Thus, they were gelled in a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous polyimide (3DOM PI) and used as composite membranes.

'Lithium batteries have the highest energy density among the commercialized secondary batteries and they are leading the path for energy storage and sources for portable applications, including electric vehicle transportation. In the past years, extensive efforts have been made to develop anode materials with high capacities. Due to the high reversible capacities, using transition metal oxides as preferable candidates for anode materials has attracts lot of attention. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is one of the considerable development potential of the anode material with high theoretical capacity (926 mAh/g), good electronic conductivity (sigma = 2 x 10<sup>4</sup> S/m, is better than that of other transition metal oxide), low cost, abundant resources, non-toxic and environmentally friendly, etc. However, huge volume change and serious agglomeration during the process of insertion/desertion of lithium ions, lead to poor cycle stability, rate ability of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> anodes [1]. In nowadays, combined with carbon materials is known as one of simplest and the most effective strategies in improving the electric conductivity and restrain volume change during the charge/discharge process. In this work, we report on the preparation of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/C composite through simple hydrothermal reaction followed by heat treatment, and its physical and electrochemical properties as anode material for lithium batteries have also been studied.

'During 30 years since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity a numerous efforts has been made to utilize this phenomena in practice. However due to extremely complicated nature of superconducting materials progress was rather modest. At present the materials of top performance in this field are so-called superconducting tapes of the second generation (2G-HTS) â the new type of 2D nanomaterials consisting of 5-10 multilayers with precisely controlled composition, structure and grain orientation within the scale of hundreds meters length. The outstanding properties of these materials allows to carry at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) electric current of enormous density (up to few millions amperes per cm<sup>2</sup>) without energy loss and in the presence of strong magnetic field of several Tesla. The combination of most advanced thin films depositing techniques including magnetron sputtering, e-beam (EB) and ion-beam assisted deposition (IBAD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been required to fabricate such a materials. So far only few companies (5-6 in the world including SuperOx) are succeed in the development and up-scaling of these techniques for commercial production of 2G-HTS.
	Since 2014 SuperOx group of companies produced and delivered several tens of kilometers of superconducting tapes with highest degree of customization to several institutions in 12 countries. Outstanding properties of the 2G-HTS tapes developed by SuperOx were tested for major energy related applications including electric energy generation, transmission and storage. Last year we presented the overview of our R&D and production activity at INESS-2015, which was held in Astana.
	In the past year we made a substantial progress in up-scaling of our production and installation of new high-throughput equipment. Currently SuperOx involved in several joint R&D and commercial projects  including  development of advanced superconducting  fault current limiters cables, current leads, induction heaters, motors and various coils for NMR/MRI magnets,  superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices and levitation bearings for the flywheels energy storage etc.

'As is known, the diffusion of copper atoms forms deep levels in the band gap of silicon [1], on which the charge carriers are trapped, resulting in a reduction of the lifetime of the minority carriers, reduce the service life and failure of solar cells. In this regard, it is necessary to create diffusion barrier between copper metallization and silicon substrate [1,2].
	In this work, the study of the films of titanium nitride Ti<sub>Ñ</sub>N<sub>Ñ</sub> and films of tantalum nitride Ta<sub>Ñ</sub>N<sub>Ñ</sub>are carried out for use as a diffusion barrier of the silicon solar cells. The deposition of sets of Ti<sub>Ñ</sub>N<sub>Ñ</sub> and Ta<sub>Ñ</sub>N<sub>Ñ</sub> films on silicon surface was made using upgraded magnetron installation MAGNA200 under different conditions in order to determine the optimal modes of deposition and synthesis. The density and thickness of the films were determined using X-ray reflectometry.
	The deposition of Ta<sub>Ñ</sub>N<sub>Ñ</sub> film (mode 1200W, 50s, N<sub>2</sub>-0.6 l/h, Ar-1.0 l/ h, 0.8Pa, 100 Â°C) resulted in the formation of the film with density of 15.63 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and thickness of about 100 nm. According to the density value, the composition of film is close to Ta<sub>2</sub>N (15.82 g/cm<sup>3</sup>).

By means of photographic X-ray diffraction the appearance of four lines corresponding to nanocrystalline phases of both TaN and Ta<sub>2</sub>N on the X-ray diffraction pattern, was observed. An increase the deposition duration up to 320s resulted to decrease of the film density up to 14.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and the formation of TaN phase.
	It is shown that TiN is formed at such condition if a ratio of consumptions of nitrogen and argon N/Ar exceeds a minimum acceptable value, which increases with decreasing flow rate of argon. With a decrease of nitrogen flow and upon reaching the minimal ratio to the consumption of argon, the TiN formation is stopped and, the deposition of titanium films contaminated by chemical non-linked nitrogen takes place.

'The world is facing serious overuse of fossil fuels, taking unpredictable but surely more and more serious environmental risks. Pursuit of green, clean and low carbon energy is now becoming of increasing urgency especially in large-scale applications in mobile or stationary fields. Electrochemical power sources with high energy, high power and long-life service are, therefore, highly desired. Among the modern electrochemical power sources, lithium-ion batteries have been a great success in portable electronic devices. However, lithium-ion batteries are facing great challenges such as safety issues and high cost for large-scale applications. Aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries are being actively studied to face these challenges [1]. A novel aqueous rechargeable battery Zn/LiCl-ZnCl<sub>2</sub>/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> with high electrochemical performance has been recently developed by our group recently [2]. However, Zn dendrites formation during cycling and using of thick separator (AGM) do not allow us to meet all requirements for large-scale applications due to limiting cycle life and volumetric energy density of this battery.
In this work, we developed Zn/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> aqueous battery with electrodeposited three-dimensional Zn anode, LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode and electro polymerized thin polymer as separator between them. Since electrodeposition is one of the most commonly practiced industrial techniques for the fabrication of zinc coatings, it can also help to reduce a general cost of battery. The thickness of the coating can easily be controlled and even the material properties can be pre-designed [3].

'Lithium metal phosphates (LiMPO<sub>4</sub>, M: transition metal) have attracted much attention as promising cathode materials for highly safe lithium-ion batteries because of their thermal and chemical stability to suppress oxygen release at charged states. One of them, LiFePO<sub>4</sub> has been already commercialized in large-scale applications such as electric vehicles and uninterruptible power supplies. However, its operating potential is as low as 3.45 V vs. Li/Li+, resulting in lower energy density of batteries than those realized by using conventional LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Thus, the application of LiMnPO<sub>4</sub> with the operating potential of 4.1 V vs. Li/Li+ has been focused. For its practical use, it is essential to know their electrochemical properties precisely. In general, an electrode active material is evaluated as a composite electrode prepared by mixing with polymer binder and carbon materials. However, the electrochemical response of a composite electrode is strongly affected by the additives, i.e. polymer binder and carbon materials. In addition, the electrode structures such as porosity and thickness also influence on the electrode response. One of effective methods to solve this problem is âsingle particle measurementâ, in which a single particle of electrode active material can be directly evaluated using a micro current collector.

Instead, engineering aspects, targeting cost reduction and safety assurance, will likely be the main driving force of future rechargeable-battery development.
	In the talk we will present the model and model-based ranking of various rechargeable battery chemistries.', DEFAULT ),

true, 'DAY I, AUGUST 11, 2016', '16.20 - 16.40', 'Conference Room #3, Library, the 4th floor',
'A formation of microcapsules with different properties for corrosion protection, based on gelatin and poly(methyl methacrylate) was studied. The microcapsules were synthesized in an aqueous-organic emulsion using the method of formation of shell on the surface of microdroplets.
The problem of metals corrosion is one of the most material-loss and costly problems in the modern industry. Common ways of metal protection from corrosion are methods using paint, oxide, phosphate or metal coatings. The electrochemical corrosion-resistant metal coatings, and corrosion-resistant composite electrochemical coatings (CEC''s) with a variety of functional additives can be used as well. However, the protective properties of these coatings can be lost due to mechanical damage or thermal exposure.
The mechanism of currently developed self-healing system is based on the protective nickel coating with microcapsules filled with chemically active substances. In case of damage of the protective coating layer in this area the thin shells of microcapsules are ruptured, releasing the healing substances, which inhibit the corrosion, processes in the damaged area.
Microcapsules were prepared by method of liquid emulsification. Two kinds of emulsions were used: for the formation of gelatin and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microcapsules.
The shell material for gelatin microcapsules is gelatin, which is strengthened by keeping the microcapsules in the solution of formalin. The solid shells of PMMA microcapsules were formed by gradual evaporation of the solvent, simultaneous with ultrasonic dispersing of PMMA-acetone-water-in-oil emulsion.
Gelatin microcapsules have diameters from 300 to 1000 nm and more loose shells, this leads to gradual release of the filler into the environment, which can be used to form a protective coating with a prolonged effect. Tests of electrochemical nickel protective composite coatings with gelatin microcapsules, containing a corrosion inhibitor, tributylphosphate, showed the reduction of the corrosion rate of steel substrates, especially when the nickel layer is damaged.
Microcapsules, based on PMMA, are differ by a dense shells and considerable stability: in the aqueous suspension there were not observed signs of aggregation or sedimentation even over a long period of time (several days). Microcapsule sizes are range from 100 to 5000 nm. A widespread water-soluble corrosion inhibitors can be stored in the core of the microcapsules for a long period of time and can be immediately released by mechanical damage of protective coating, containing these microcapsules.', DEFAULT ),

'In the next decade, Kazakhstan, being one of the big producers and exporters of the hydrocarbon resources, should accelerate technological modernization of the energy system and development of energy saving technologies. Kazakhstan is expected to be one of the major coal producers during the next decade. Currently Kazakhstani electricity production accounts for 76 power plants with installed power capacity of around 20.6 GW. However, the available capacity is 17.1 GW (16.9% less than its installed capacity) [1]. This capacity drop is explained by the high wear out of the generation units and requires a thorough management plan. Storage technologies loaded at low energy demand and utilized at high demand periods have a positive effect in management of energy networks [2].
This work addresses the optimization-based modelling of the energy supply chains of Kazakhstan. Its aim is to construct an investment model for the development of national electricity grid by creating additional renewable energy sources (photovoltaic modules and wind turbines) with different level of integration of storage technologies. The model is designed as a linear program under cost minimization regime with an hourly time resolution.  Configuration of power system is represented with characteristics that approximate realistic status of generation, demand and transmission units of power system of Kazakhstan for 2013 [1]. The potential of solar and wind power has been estimated using the data obtained from meteorological companies that are located in nearby regions studying the climate of the regions. Industrial and residential demand data is estimated for the long-term timeline with the predictions until 2050.
The proposed model determines the optimal way of implementation of energy storage technologies and renewable energy sources, their capacity and amount of investment. Tests on various levels of implementation of storage technologies resulted in the optimal ratio of 13.5% of installed capacity of storage to installed capacity of renewables. ', DEFAULT ),

'The objective of using the proposed method based on microporous structure development is to produce new inexpensive carbon matrix which could be used as efficient active component of electrode material implemented in electric double layer capacitors (EDLC).
Produced carbons are characterized by a highly developed polymodal porous texture [1]. These nanostructured materials were produced through the process of one step carbonization and chemical activation of vegetable biomass by the use of phosphoric acid. It was found that for the development of activated carbon''s microporous structure, the impregnation ratio can play a crucial role. Also, the range of temperature treatment and the initial carbonaceous precursor features can contribute to that. The specific surface area of samples derived on the base of rice husks, apricot stones and walnut shell calculated by BET was equal to 1690 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 2030 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1380 m<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively [2].
Micro-mesoporous activated carbons were electrochemically investigated as active components of symmetric electrodes in a two electrode cell. The specific capacitance of the cell retains 160 F/g after 1000 charge-discharge cycles in 1 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte. Electrode materials are also characterized by a great ability to polarization. Indicated value of specific capacitance corresponds to the characteristics of the capacity of commercially available carbons based on carbonized coconut shell. However, proposed porous carbons with advanced surface texture were produced by simple processing of vegetable biomass that traditionally grows in Kazakhstan and usually forms a large-tonnage waste.
The average pore size of the sample presented by the carbon derived through activation of rice husk lies between 1.2 and 1.6 nm. In this case, the pore diameter corresponds to the dimension of the solvated ions in the electrolyte. This trend can positively influence the diffusion processes associated with the mass transfer in the micropore volume of the electrode material. Therefore, main specific characteristics based on EDLC can be improved significantly.', DEFAULT ),

'Due to the advantages of Li/S batteries, such as high theoretical capacity of sulfur cathode 1672 mAh/g, low cost and toxicity, this technology considered as one of the most promising next generation batteries.
However, there are several drawbacks restricting widely use of this type of batteries: poor cycling performance because of solubility of polysulfides in an organic electrolytes; safety issue, due to use of lithium metal anode; and electrical-insulating nature of sulfur resulting in its low utilization.
In order to overcome these issues and commercialize Li-ion/S technology we synthesized S/Conductive polymer/C based ternary compositeand electrochemically constructed a Li-ion/S battery using lithiated graphite as anode. Furthermore, high mass loading of sulfur based cathode composite was achieved [1]. S/Conductive polymer/Cternary compositeshowedvery good electrochemical performance - 1500 mAh/g at 0.2 C, with 82% capacity retention after 200 cycles and high coulombic efficiency. The pouch lithium metal free rechargeable Li-ion Sulfur batteriespassed safety and some other tests required for further implementation of these batteries.
